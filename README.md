# Word-Guess-Game

This game utilizes all the concepts crammed into my head during the one week crash course in javascript.
A lot of what was crammed in my head leaked out onto the floor, but I was able to scoop it back up and pour it into my 
brainhole. I think you'll find that process reflected here.

You will find:
* An array of words
* An array of acceptable characters
* Global variables
* Variable for DOM manipulations
* A random word generator
* Process for displaying that random word as an array of blanks
* Function to reset conditions for next game
* The game function itself with:
  * If else statements
  * A for loop *INSIDE* of an if else statement!
*a starting event that calls the game function

All this and CSS too!
